* Project Overview: The main theorem of the project is to enable food ordering for customers without the need for staff. The project will utilize the same Wi-Fi connection as the customer's phone.

* System Requirements: The project files should be stored in the local host and must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the customer's phone for the project to function properly.

* Publishing and Accessibility: Once the project is published online, it can be accessed from any mobile device with an internet connection.

* Project Start:
 -->To start the project, the user needs to click on the logo.
  
* System Requirements:
 -->The project is designed to run on a local host server, which means that the mobile device and the computer running the project should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
 -->The Wi-Fi network should be a public network, not a private one.
 -->To find the IP address of the computer running the project, the user can follow these steps:
  
* Open the Command Prompt.
 -->Type the command "ipconfig" and press Enter.
 -->Look for the IPv4 address under the "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" section.
 -->The IP address obtained in the previous step should be used in all the existing files and run them with a live server.
  
* Accessing the Project on a Mobile Device:
 -->Once all the files are running on the Wi-Fi IP address, the user can generate a QR code by visiting a QR code generation website and scanning it with their mobile device's QR code scanner.
